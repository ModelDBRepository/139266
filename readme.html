Matlab simulation of a single neuron with dynamic ion concentrations.
It shows the sudden depolarization that can be observed when a neuron
is not supplied with energy (ischemia).

code by Bas-Jan Zandt, b.zandt@utwente.nl
from the paper:

Neural dynamics during anoxia and the ``Wave of Death''
(<a href="http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022127">http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022127</a>)

Partially based on Cressman et al., 2009, The influence of sodium and
potassium dynamics on excitability, seizures, and the stability of
persistent states J Comput Neurosci 26: 159-170

Usage:

Type runmodel at the matlab command prompt. After a minute or so you
should see a few figures, one of which (figure 4):

contains in the area near 530 the behavior depicted in Figure 2 (left
panel) in the paper:
